Apache Tika - a content analysis toolkit The Apache Tika™ toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and much more. You can find the latest release on the download page. Please see the Getting Started page for more information on how to start using Tika. The Parser and Detector pages describe the main interfaces of Tika and how they work. For more in-depth documentation, see our wiki, especially for tika-server. If you're interested in contributing to Tika, please see the Contributing page or send an email to the Tika development list. Tika is a project of the Apache Software Foundation, and was formerly a subproject of Apache Lucene. Latest News 6 February 2025: Apache Tika Release Apache Tika 2.9.3 has been released!
